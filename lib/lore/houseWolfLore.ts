The Kamposian Dragoons were a clan-based culture composed of members from multiple species and bound by a common creed, language, and code. Known primarily as highly-effective mercenaries and bounty hunters, Kamposian Dragoons or "Dragoons" have at various points in galactic history played a major role as legendary warriors and conquerors.

Originating on the planet of Kampos (Ellis IV), the Dragoons' way of life revolved around honor and war. As a result of their warrior culture, the Dragoons launched several wars of expansion by colonizing nearby worlds, leading the sector surrounding their home world to be known as Dragoon Space.

However, although Kampos was still under control of traditional Dragoon warriors, much of the planet's population had become part of a pacifist movement known as the New Dragoons, led by the young Duchess Satine Kryze of House Kryze. The traditionalist warriors were forced to use violence to hold on to power. Eventually, a civil war broke out between the pacifist New Dragoons movement and the martial traditionalists, who wished to maintain their warrior heritage.

Kampos' capital was destroyed during the Dragoon Civil War, and many perished during the conflict, including Duke Adonai Kryze, Satine's father. Satine herself had to remain under protection as the traditionalists sent bounty hunters after her. Kampos' traditionalist minority was eventually defeated during the war. While the Death Watch, a traditionalist group under Dragoon Pre Vizsla, wished to retake their home world, the Old Dragoons scattered across the galaxy as mercenaries.

The Dragoon Code of Honor is broken down into three facets: strength, honor, and death - all of which tie into the Dragoons being a warrior culture centered on armor, weapons, and war. The Dragoon Code of Honor states: "Strength is life, for the strong have the right to rule; Honor is life, for with no honor one may as well be dead; Death is life, one should die as they have lived."

The first aspect of strength means that if Dragoons meet a weaker person or people, they have the right to conquer them and absorb them into the Dragoons' way of life.

The Dragoon Code of Honor does not concern a person's death in and of itself, but rather how the person dies. If a Dragoon dies with strength and honor, then their death is an acceptable one that abides by the code.

The Dragoons' Resol'nare is broken down into six principles: raising children as Dragoons, wearing the Dragoon armor, mastering self-defense, devoting one's self to the clan's welfare, speaking the Dragoon language, and answering the Dragoon leader's call to action. Dragoon houses place their house name before the word Dragoon to identify their house allegiance, for example: "Wolf Dragoons".
